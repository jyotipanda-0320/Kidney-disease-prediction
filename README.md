# Kidney-disease-prediction

Collaborated on interpreting patient data to identify key predictors affecting kidney health.
It aims to identify individuals at risk of developing kidney disease or to diagnose existing conditions. 
It analyzes patient data, including demographics, clinical history, and laboratory test results, to determine the likelihood of kidney disease. 
The model outputs a prediction or risk score, which can help clinicians in decision-making and provide early warning for patients at risk. By leveraging historical data, the prediction model can support early intervention, helping to prevent progression to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).

Features:
In kidney disease prediction, predictors are selected based on their relevance to kidney function and overall health. Unique insights into kidney health have been demonstrated, helping to improve predictive accuracy by implementing correlation analysis.
